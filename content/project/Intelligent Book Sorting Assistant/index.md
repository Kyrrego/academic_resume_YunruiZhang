Developed an app on which the librarian can learn whether the order of the books is correct by taking a picture of a row on the bookshelf.

Applied OCR and deep learning to improve the recognition of call numbers in the images. 

Labeled over 1,000 pictures of books as dataset, filling in the absence of datasets in library scenarios.

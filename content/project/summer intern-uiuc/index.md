Proposed a novel deep learning-based method for magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) reconstruction, which can achieve high-quality MRSI reconstruction from highly undersampled parallel imaging brain data.

Devised specialized convolutional kernels and a complex convolutional neural network architecture to enhance both the efficiency of training and the quality of reconstruction.

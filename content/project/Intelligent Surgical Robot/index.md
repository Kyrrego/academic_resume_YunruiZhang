Pioneered the utilization of surgical robotics in clinical facial injection-based plastic surgery treatments.

Innovated the creation of a comprehensive 3D multi-modal deep digital facial model for precise surgical planning.

Engineered advanced facial 3D spatial navigation control and path planning algorithms specifically tailored for surgical robots, alongside cutting-edge probe localization and pose matching algorithms.

abstract: This pioneering work introduces a groundbreaking approach to orthopedic cosmetic procedures, specifically hyaluronic acid injections. By intelligently selecting the injection sites, it allows for meticulous surgical planning. The incorporation of surgical robots for assistance in injections marks a significant leap towards the digitization, automation, and intelligentization of cosmetic surgeries. This advancement not only elevates the precision of the procedures but also liberates physicians from the monotony of repetitive tasks. It paves the way for a new era of intelligent medical solutions in the realm of orthopedic cosmetics.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This work is the first to focus on hyaluronic acid injection treatment in cosmetic surgery, achieving precise surgical planning and automatic injection using surgical robots.

abstract: Parallel imaging has been used to accelerate the slow MRSI acquisition [1]. The commonly used linear methods, such as SENSE [2] and GRAPPA [3] based methods, still produce residual aliasing of water/lipid signals which are significant enough to disrupt spatiospectral processing for metabolite reconstruction. Nonlinear k-space interpolation methods have demonstrated success in parallel MRI [4]. RAKI (Robust Artificial neural networks for k‚Äêspace Interpolation) [5][6] has been designed to calibrate CNN from autocalibration signal (ACS) data which can later be employed on the whole undersampled k-space. However, RAKI has thus far been applied exclusively to MRI data. Formerly, MRSI reconstruction has also seen the integration of neural networks [7]. Nevertheless, these approaches focused on nonlinear relationships within the k-space domain, overlooking valuable information in the temporal dimension.

In this work, we adapted and extended the self-supervised learning-based RAKI method by incorporating the FID dimension into a 3D, complex-valued convolutional network, for MRSI reconstruction. We improved the design by training a single network to handle multi-coil data simultaneously instead of the coil-by-coil interpolation in the original RAKI method. We demonstrate reduced aliasing by the proposed method and consequently improved spatiospectral processing results, using in vivo 1H-MRSI data. 


# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this work, we proposed a self-supervised learning-based (k,t)-space interpolation method, (k,t)-RAKI, that is useful for further accelerating MRSI acquisition, in combination with subspace methods.

Hi! I am Yunrui Zhang (Âº†Ëä∏Áùø), a final-year (senior) undergraduate student majoring in [Automation at Tsinghua University](https://www.au.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). 


My research interests lie broadly in **the intersection of advanced healthcare and engineering**, including Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) & Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy Imaging (MRSI), multi-modal biomedical imaging and surgical robotics. 


Throughout my undergraduate studies, I have always been actively involved in scientific research, exploring a variety of fields.
From July to September 2023, I was a summer research intern at Beckman Institute, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, where I worked with [Prof. Fan Lam](https://bioengineering.illinois.edu/people/fanlam1) and focused on the application of deep learning methods to improve MRSI reconstruction. 
Since October 2022, I have been the leader of Intelligent Surgical Robot Team at Tsinghua University under the guidance of [Prof. Gangtie Zheng](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37694930000) and [Prof. Xiao Long](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Xiao-Long-8). 
Prior to that, I worked with [Prof. Rebing Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=rIaG61EAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and [Prof. Herschel Rabitz](https://chemistry.princeton.edu/faculty-research/faculty/herschel-rabitz/) on the application of machine learning methods in quantum control. Please feel free to continue scrolling down this page to see more of my research!


During my leisure time, I am an enthusiast of classic Chinese literature & poetry üìú, contemporary fiction üìñ, piano üéπ and musicals üé∂.

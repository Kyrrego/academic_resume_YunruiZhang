              * Proposed a self-supervised learning-based (k,t)-space interpolation method, (k,t)-RAKI, that is useful for further accelerating MRSI acquisition, in combination with subspace methods.
              * Devised specialized convolutional kernels and a complex convolutional neural network architecture to enhance both the efficiency of training and the quality of reconstruction.
              * Effectively reconstructed data for different undersampling designs in in vivo brain MRSI, leading to improved subsequent spatiospectral processing results.
